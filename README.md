# What are pair potentials? Givee three examples?

The interaction of any pair of atoms depends only on their spacing and is not affected by the presence of other atoms. Lennard-Jones, Morse potential, and hard spheres are some examples of Pair potentials. These methods are Empirical because their formalism is obtained from experiment, not from theory.

# What are multi-body potentials? Give three examples?

Ans: The interaction of a pair of atoms is modified by the presence of a third atom. Embedded atom method, Modified embedded atom method and Stillinger-weber(3 body potential used to model solids with strong covalent bonds e.g. carbon, germanium, silicon, and diamond) are some examples of multibody potentials. These methods are semi-empirical because their formalism uses some theoretical conceptions and experimental data.
