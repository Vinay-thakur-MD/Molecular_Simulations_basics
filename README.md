QN: What are pair potentials? Give three examples with their application?
Ans: The interaction of any pair of atoms depends only on their spacing and is not affected by the presence of other atoms. Lennard-Jones(used to study noble gases at low temperature), Morse potential, and hard spheres are some examples of Pair potentials. They are used to study nobles gases at low temperatures and van der Waal interaction in organic materials. These methods are Empirical because their formalism is obtained from experiment, not from theory.
